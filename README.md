## :link: API

### :question: Which API did I use?

This Web App has been designed and developed with the [the Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/).  
Giphy has the largest GIF library in the world and their API makes it possible to seamlessly integrate these GIFs into any application.

### :eyes: What can you do with this API?

_All information can also be found on [the Giphy website](https://giphy.com)_

- Return a random GIF
- Show trending GIFs to users
- Let the user search for GIFs, using a word or phrase
- Convert what the user typed into the input field into the perfect GIF using their :sparkles:special sauce:sparkles: algorithm
- Autocomplete user input with a list of valid terms that completes what the user has typed into the input field
- Generate a unique ID to assign to each new user in an application
- Generate one or multiple GIFs by ID endpoint
